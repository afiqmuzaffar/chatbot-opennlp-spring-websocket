/**
 * A <code>DialogTreeNode</code> is a restricted implementation of 
 * <code>IConversationNode</code> that
 * holds a text string to represent the displayed conversation snippet and 
 * retrieves a list of allowed responses from the outbound edges. 
 * By default the snippet and allowed
 * responses will be rendered unchanged, but this class can easily be extended
 * to use a template engine for string substitution.
 * <p>
 * A dialog tree is a type of branching conversation often seen in adventure
 * video games. The user is given a choice of what to say and makes subsequent
 * choices until the conversation ends. The responses to the user are scripted
 * based on the choices made. Each DialogTreeNode represents either a question
 * or statement presented to the user by the bot.
 * <p>
 * A <code>DialogTreeNode</code> can either be a statement or question. 
 * A statement will not
 * stop the conversation, continuing along the outbound edge to the next node if
 * available. A question will stop the conversation and wait for a a response
 * from the user. The suggested responses for a question are taken from the
 * content of the outbound edges.
